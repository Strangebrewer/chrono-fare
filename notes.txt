Add component to search users by username or name (search is done and working).
   - fix search. A couple of options:
      - exclude: '@', the domain (i.e. 'gmail'), and '.com', '.net', etc.
      - save the email address in two fields: email_name and email
         - these could be populated by splitting the given email - email.split('@') will remove the '@' and produce an array with the two resulting items,
         - save the full email address in the email field, and just the first array item [0] from the email.split('@') result.
   - Clicking the name in the search results should take you to their door
   - Doors should have a button for sending a friend request
   
You should have two lists:
   - Friends
   - Fridge Mates
Food can be shared with all friends, all fridge mates, or specific people

Add functionality to upload an image or paste the address for one (for profile pic)

Add a text editor for adding recipes:
   - Recipe name
   - the recipe itself can be formatted by the user (see dragon writer editors)
   - Your door can have a link to your recipes page
